# Timestamper for Obsidian

Timestamper allows to insert the current time into a note. It's particularly useful for logging or journaling in daily notes.

The plugin provides one main command that can be customised to fit your workflow.

## Features

-   **Insert Timestamp**: Adds a command to insert the current time, formatted to your preference.
-   **Auto-Open Daily Note**: If you're not in today's daily note, the plugin can open it for you before inserting the timestamp.
-   **Customisable Format**: You can define the exact format for the timestamp (the default is `# HH:MM`).
-   **Flexible Insertion**: Choose to insert the timestamp at the very end of the document or at the first empty line below your cursor.
-   **Auto-Scroll**: Optionally scrolls to the bottom of the note after inserting the timestamp, keeping your view focused.

## How to Install

1.  Open **Settings** in Obsidian.
2.  Go to **Community plugins** and make sure that «Restricted mode» is turned **off**.
3.  Click **Browse** to open the community plugins store.
4.  Search for «Timestamper».
5.  Click **Install**, and then **Enable** once it has downloaded.

## How to Use

The main function of the plugin is the **`Timestamper: Insert timestamp`** command, which you can find in the command palette. For quicker access, I recommend assigning a hotkey to it in Obsidian's «Hotkeys» settings.

### Settings

You can configure the plugin's behaviour under `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Timestamper`.

-   **Auto-open daily note**: When enabled, the plugin will find and open today's daily note if you trigger the command from another file.
-   **Scroll to bottom**: Automatically scrolls to the end of the note after the timestamp is added.
-   **Insert at document end**: Toggles between inserting the timestamp at the very end of the note or at the next available empty line below the cursor.
-   **Timestamp format**: Lets you specify the format.
